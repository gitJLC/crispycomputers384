                  <p>After weeks of searching, I recently bought a lenovo thinkpad t480s for 36 bucks on ebay. the seller mistakenly listed the laptop as a T480. How did I know it was not a T480? It was because the seller listed pictures of the Lenovo Diagnostics Tool screen and under Production Version was labeled Thinkpad T480s. Knowing that, I used that to my advantage by sending a counteroffer knowing that the listing was mismatched and that the shipping cost was high. After I sent my counteroffer, I received the laptop around November 14th.</p>
<p>The hardware specs of the laptop include:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU:&nbsp; Intel Core I7 8650U</li>
<li>RAM: 40GB of sodimm DDR4</li>
<li>Storage: 256GB PCIE 3.0 GEN 4 NVME SSD</li>
<li>Display: 1920x1080</li>
<li>OS: Fedora Linux (Sway) / Gentoo Linux (DWM)</li>
</ul>
<p>Originally, I used Gentoo for the main OS for the laptop (and I still have the original drive that it was installed on) because I liked how gentoo can be made to have low overhead on system resources and can be optimized and tailored for the machine you installed it on. However, It takes a tremendous amount of time and tinkering to get it exactly right on this thinkpad. I'm the kind of person who would spend forever obsessing and tinkering over the most optimial configuration for my gentoo build. Therefore, I needed a distro that comes with sane defaults and reasonable overhead. Fedora fit that description because it comes with sane defaults such as BTRFS snapshots, Selinux enabled by default, full disk encryption when chosen at installation, and a comfy desktop experience with a wide selection of packages. I chose sway because wayland itself has a lower overhead than the X-server and that I was already familiar with the I3 configurations that they chose. I did want to go with Rocky Linux (and rocky linux can be made into a competent desktop) but I read that you would have to undo a lot of what Rocky Linux stable in order to to do normal desktop things. The thing about fedora is that you're still in the RHEL ecosystem while also able to do normal desktop things that you wouldn't otherwise shouldn't do in Rocky. So far, I'm satisfied with my experience with my thinkpad. I still need to see how painful system upgrades are with Fedora when the next release comes out but so far I am ok with the experience that I have with it.&nbsp;</p>
