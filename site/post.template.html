                  <div class="container">
        <p>I initially wanted to make an arcade stick for myself because I wanted to start playing fighting games. I&apos;ve been around and exposed to the Fighting Game Community multiple times throughout my life but I always felt that I wasn&apos;t skilled enough or the scene itself was too intense for kids like me growing up in the 2000s and 2010s (since they were mostly high school and college age people in and around the scene).&nbsp;</p>
<p>My brother and his friends used to go to one of the most influential arcades in the west coast, Family Fun Arcade. This is where pillars of the fighting game community honed their skills and cut their teeth on to become one of the greats that we have today for the FGC. Influential pillars of the community such as Justin Wong and Maximilian Dood frequented Family Fun Arcade up until its closure in 2012.</p>
<p>I only ever been to Family Fun about once in my life in December of that year in 2012 but I remember it fondly. The blinking lights and the intensity of the crowd still lives in my mind to this day and I&apos;ve been wanting to get in on that experience ever since. My interests waxes and wanes but Fighting Games have almost been a near constant in my life. I decided that in 2019 that I wanted to build an arcade stick for myself. I took a trigonometry and geometry class earlier in 2018 so I wanted to use those skills in drafting and designing my own arcade stick. I sketched out a rectangular box with a hinged frames and enough space for expansion if I so desire.<br><br>The initial design, mark 1, was made out of common household parts found at home depot. It was made of brass fixtures, brass hinges, magnets for securing the lid in place, and was made almost entirely out of oak wood. It contained a sanwa jlf-tp-8yt joystick and accompanying obsf-24mm buttons. These are the kinds of components that would you find in original Japanese Arcade caddy style cabinets, such as the Naomi machines provided by capcom, and more notably the same kind of cabinets you would find back in Family Fun Arcade.</p>
<p>My original design for the arcade stick was robust but was also big and somewhat clunky. I had &nbsp;the idea in mind that I wanted an arcade stick that would last me years and that I can perpetually upgrade but found that the choice of materials and size made it somewhat cumbersome to use. For mark 2, I focused on portability as main feature and factor. In 2022, I got my first 3D printer which enabled me to create more things for my hobbies and do more projects. I found a creator on thingiverse who created their own small and portable arcade stick that perfectly fit the components that I&apos;ve chosen from mark 1. Originally, Mark 1 used a generic arcade stick controller that only works on PCs. Surprising, the creator also modeled in a place for that generic controller to fit so it was basically form fitted to work. I did have less buttons to work with, 6 instead of 8, but considering that most fighters, such as Marvel vs capcom 2 and Dragonball FighterZ, can work with 6 buttons I had no problem adapting.</p>
<p>Mark 2 was great because it was portable and was easy serviceable but the problem was that due to its compact design It made accessing certain components difficult. It was secured with standard metric screws and nuts. Each nut was gorilla glued in place which did not make for the best fit since I found that the metal had a hard time bonding the plastic. I could&apos;ve heat set it in place but even then, the design was fighting itself.<br><br>In comes Mark 3 where entire design and revamped to be fit for true competitive play. My brother needed an arcade stick since he was getting beat left and right at Street Fighter Third strike. His work has accommodations for employees and that includes a mini arcade that they use after work. One night, he approached me and asked me about the arcade stick I had. I said that I have it but it needs some work to get it in proper order. After a few weeks, I made it into what I&apos;m proud of today. It still uses the same components from previous revisions but makes a new revision in the case design. The design was created bottom up by a creator and modeler named VanJoBi. The entire design is 3D printed just like the previous Mark 2 but with notable differences. One is that it is significantly larger than the previous mark 2 and that it includes modular face plates for interchangeable functionality. You could have multiple butons and layouts from hitbox to 6 or 8 buttons and more. for Mark 3, I upgraded the board to brooks fighting board so now it has full functionality with multiple consoles such as the Playstation 5, Playstation 4, and the nintendo switch.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
