                      <p>So I've been building mechancial keyboards for about 7 to 8 years now. I've heard of mechanical keyboards in the mid 2010s from creators such as Barnacules with his review of drop's, then called Massdrop, planck keyboards. That was the first time I've heard of custom mechanical keyboards. I heard about regular cherry mechanical keyboards before such as Razr's Black Widow keyboards and other various mechanical keyboard models in the early 2010s but as a pre-teen growing up with little to no allowance, A full size mechanical keyboard was a bit out of reach for me.</p>
<p>The idea of a custom keyboard intrigued me since it scratched my maker itch and it gave a personal touch to the maker who made it. Planck keyboards were awesome because they had an unorthodox keyboard layout and was fully customizable. Granted, most mechanical keyboards worth their salt today come with some if not all of those features but back then, you would be hard press to find any commerical solutions to custom mechanical keyboards other than the offering that you find on massdrop or other various bespoke sellers. Planck keyboards were cool because they were in an ortholinear design (so you reduce the chance of carpal tunnel when typing), had customizable keyboard layouts where you could switch between dvorak, qwerty, or even map macros to different layers to add more functionality to your keyboard, various led lighting modes, etc. So you may be asking yourself, "why is he talking about planck keyboards instead of the Article's namesake?" It's because the features that come from the planck keyboard is the operating ethos that I use when creating a new custom mechanical keyboards for myself or others. What I want out of a mechanical keyboard is to be fully hackable, custom, and have a personal flair. I think that a keyboard should have a story to tell to anyone who uses it.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why I picked up a wasd code v2 keyboard. For one, I wanted a full size daily driver keyboard to use. Two, I missed having a number pad to use and I wanted to become more proficient at touch typing with a number pad. Three, back in the day I considered the wasd code keyboards to be my endgame for mechancial keyboards because that was the keyboard that I would've wanted as a teen. Those are all the reasons why I wanted this particular keyboard, It was just nostalgic for me to have and I saw an oppertuinity on ebay to bid and win for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I first got the keyboard from ebay in 2023, the thing was covered in swamp gooch and mystery stains from the previous owner. Nevertheless, I cleaned up as much as I could from the previous owner, using soapy water and an ungodly amount of IPA cleaner, to get the keyboard in clean and working order. I think focused on what I wanted to do with my keyboard modifications. I knew I wanted new switches and that I had new keycaps coming into the mail I bought in 2021, so I went to amazon and found an under rated switch that typed comfortably and was reasonably priced. I believe it was an MMD cream switch which I bought a pack of 110 switches for about 25 dollars. Originally, the keyboard came equipped with MX clear switches but I didn't want to have any carry over from the swamp gooch that is definitely trapped inside those switches. I also wanted to replace the bright white LEDs with green LEDs to fit the neon aesthetic I was looking for in this particular build. Moreover, I wanted to include usb type c instead of the usb micro b port that it came equipped with from the factory.&nbsp;Fortunately, WASD does make new shells and conversion kits for this particular model of keyboard so I was able to buy new parts in order for my project to get going.<br /><br /></p>
<p>I took some time in November of 2023 to plan and carry out the mods I wanted to make in this build. I started by disassembling the keyboard to figure out how it was assembled at the factory. Of course, they were using plastic tabs instead of mostly screws to hold it together. Moreover, I removed all of the keycaps that came with the board and removed the costar stabilizers along with it. I was then left with the switches, plate, and pcb. Since the designers went with a plate mounted design, I had to desolder each and every switch on the board for full replacement with the MMD cream switches. This whole process took about a weekend or two to complete. After that process, I replaced all 104 switches on the board and relubed the costar stabilizers with tribosys 3204. Keep in mind, the MMD cream switches already came lubed from the factory so adding more lube would change the feel and sound of what was already a great sounding and feeling switch.<br /><br />Some time passed after the inital modifications I made to the keyboard. Earlier in 2024, I was able to find a blemished alluminum keyboard case for the code v2 to wrap up most of the modifications that I made to it. In the end, I now have a custom full size mechanical keyboard that I am proud to call my own. However, there are some changes that I would like to make with the board in order to get it in better shape. For one, there is a problem with the led lights that I picked where It tends to bind to the GMK keycaps that I have picked for it. It's no problem when you're touch typing and pressing the button for no more than a half of a second but when you're pressing and holding a switch it then frequently binds and therefore becomes stuck. I already have a solution to that problem but I need to find the time to make those changes. Another problem that I have also noticed is that the blemished alluminum case has the wrong holes tapped for mounting the usb type c port for the keyboard. I would need to go in with a drill press and make the appropiate hole taps for mounting. One upgrade that I have yet to make for this keyboard is full QMK compatibility. The code v2 is set up for adding additional extension cards to it above the arrow keys but I would need to design a breakout board for that extension port for QMK. Fortunately, someone already did the hard part of creating a breakout board and open sourced the project on github so when I am able to get cheap pcb maufacturing I'll take a shot at adding that feature in.</p>
